# Curriculum

## Week 1: Introduction to Python
Our goal will be to learn the basics of the Python language. We will review proper syntax, variables, expression, functions, loops and iterations. We will work on a project designed by Jetbrains (Zookeeper python project) as a way to apply our studies. Additionally, we will be working through Michigan University's 
Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) chapter 1 to chapter 7.

## Curriculum Outline from NYC Data Science Academy to be combined with above ^^^ 

At the foundation level of the program, students learn to employ R and Python for data analytics
projects and for presenting research results effectively. Beyond the foundational level, students study
machine learning with R and Python and carry out research projects that involve advanced data
science methods and strategies. The program also exposes students to concepts and practices in
deep learning and big data.
