## Skills
- R and Python programming
- Statistics
- Visualisation
- Machine learning Algorithms

Data collection and cleaning— You are required to collection a large amount of data using different tools and technologies. This data is unstructured and needs to be cleaned to filter data that’s really required.
Analysis — You use statistical techniques to analyse data.
Visualisation — You need to know tools like Tableau, gglpots.
Predictive modelling— You need to know machine learning algorithms for these.
Now, looking at the above skills you might feel that it’s a lot of learn for a fresher. It definitely is. However, you don’t have to learn all these skills at once. You can begin by learning statistics. I recently wrote an answer on this which you can refer below.
