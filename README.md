Statistics
Data collection and cleaning— You are required to collection a large amount of data using different tools and technologies. 

This data is unstructured and needs to be cleaned to filter data that’s really required.

Analysis — You use statistical techniques to analyse data.
Visualisation — You need to know tools like Tableau, gglpots.
Predictive modelling— You need to know machine learning algorithms for these.

## Techniques

1. Exploratory data analysis
2 Missing value analysis
3. Outlier analysis
4. Feature scaling
5. Sampling techniques
6. Error Metrics Classification
7. Error Metrics Regression
8. Random Forest
9. Linear Regression
10. Logistic regression
11. Visualisations
12. KNN
13. Native Bayes

## Curriculum -- To Be Summarized

Data science is a fast-evolving field and offers many employment opportunities for people with a robust
operational analysis background. In recent years, technological development in data collection and
storage and innovations in data science tools and methodologies have made it even more important
to have properly trained data analysts and data scientists to perform data analyses to gain business
insights.
NYC Data Science Academy designed the Data Science Bootcamp to provide accelerated training to
fulfill the need for data science professionals in the employment market. The objective of the Data
Science Bootcamp is to provide training in primary data science tools and methods that prepares
students for employment opportunities across all industries as data science professionals.
Program Description
The Data Science Bootcamp program is an advanced certificate program that is designed primarily
for individuals who have earned a baccalaureate or higher degree and want to further their career in
the field of data science. It is a very accelerated training program in which students learn the major
tools and methods for performing data analyses and apply them to various projects typically found in
the data science field.
At the foundation level of the program, students learn to employ R and Python for data analytics
projects and for presenting research results effectively. Beyond the foundational level, students study
machine learning with R and Python and carry out research projects that involve advanced data
science methods and strategies. The program also exposes students to concepts and practices in
deep learning and big data.

Prework
Once students are enrolled in the bootcamp, they are granted access to our online, self-paced prework materials:
● 20-30 hours: Introductory Python (Optional)
● 35-45 hours: Data Analysis and Visualization with R
● 20-30 hours: Data Analysis and Visualization with Python
Students are also invited to join their cohort’s Slack channel, where they meet their future
classmates, instructors, and get support on pre-work assignments.
Enrolled bootcamp students can also choose to take part-time, beginner-level courses hosted at our
NYC campus for preparation. Tuition paid for such courses will be credited as part of bootcamp
tuition.
