Start by learning the following skills, you need to know these to work in data science—

R and Python programming
Statistics
Visualisation
Machine learning
These skills are important to start a career in data science. In fact, these skills form the foundation of every major task that a data scientist does. These technologies ( or skills) are utilised across these —

Data collection and cleaning— You are required to collection a large amount of data using different tools and technologies. This data is unstructured and needs to be cleaned to filter data that’s really required.
Analysis — You use statistical techniques to analyse data.
Visualisation — You need to know tools like Tableau, gglpots.
Predictive modelling— You need to know machine learning algorithms for these.
Now, looking at the above skills you might feel that it’s a lot of learn for a fresher. It definitely is. However, you don’t have to learn all these skills at once. You can begin by learning statistics. I recently wrote an answer on this which you can refer below.

Gautam Tiwari's answer to How can I become a data scientist?

Next, you can learn R and Python programming, and predictive modelling using machine learning algorithms.

Now, as a fresher, you’re not required to know all of the above skills. It’s just that companies have priorities when they hire a data scientist or a data analyst, it and completely depends on what they expect their candidate to do. While some companies might require you to do all of the above tasks, at a few companies you just need to perform one or few tasks. However, it’s to best learn the basics of all, if possible. This will give you more opportunities and you would know what you are more comfortable with.

Next, as a fresher, the following are some major techniques you should focus on. As these techniques are frequently used in data analysis and companies look for candidates who have strong command on these. This will help you make your chances better for getting your first data science job.

1. Exploratory data analysis

2 Missing value analysis

3. Outlier analysis

4. Feature scaling

5. Sampling techniques

6. Error Metrics Classification

7. Error Metrics Regression

8. Random Forest

9. Linear Regression

10. Logistic regression

11. Visualisations

12. KNN

13. Native Bayes

All in all, learn the above skills. Next, you should focus on projects. If you can work on projects related to all the above. It would be great, else you should focus majorly on data collection and cleaning projects. As this is the major skill that companies look for in freshers and in most cases that is also their primary task. Hence, if you have done projects related to collection and cleaning, it would immensely increase your chances of getting a job in data science.

Also, companies prefer candidates who come with data handling experience. Having projects ensures that you can look after data without losing it. As losing data can cause loss of millions to companies and in case of sensitive data, it can also jeopardise a business.

When you have the skills and projects, you can apply for jobs. Apply thorough Angellist. You will find start-ups, and early stage start-ups here. Or you can also apply through company websites.

Put simply, you should follow this simple approach —

Learn the skills required to be a data scientist
Work on projects
Get hired as a Data Scientist
You can use platforms like Udemy, Udacity, Edureka, edWisor to learn the above skills. However, I would suggest you to use edwisor. Here you can learn all the above skills while working on projects. These projects can be easily used as your portfolio. Plus, there are a lot of analytics companies that hire for data science roles through edwisor based on the projects people do here. So give it a spin.
