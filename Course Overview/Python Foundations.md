# Introduction to Python - Foundations
Our goal is to learn the fundamentals of the Python language by reviewing proper syntax, variables, expression, functions, loops and iterations. We will be working through University of Michigan's [Programming for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?#enroll)'s first and second course - [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python) and [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python) for our foundations. Additionally, we will work on the Zookeeper python project designed by [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) as a way to apply our studies.
